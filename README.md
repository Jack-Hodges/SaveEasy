# SaveEasy
SaveEasy is an app created to motivate kids to save money!💰
Kids create their own profile 🤩, set their saving goal 💪, choose their colour scheme 🎨, and complete jobs posted by parents to earn money 🎉

Parents can view their childs current savings progress, and add and monitor the jobs their children can see!

Children can see the jobs their parents post, as well as a progress indicator showing them how close they are to their goal! They can even change their theme colour.
